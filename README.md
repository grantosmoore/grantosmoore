__Hello__, this is my *special* repository! (But I imagine your just seeing this on my profile!)

Here I am, beginning my journey with developing and cloud engineering!
I have decided to include some lovely __MARKDOWN__ commands into writing this (I have *never* and I mean *__never__* used this before!)

I will add some socials, and what I am working on here at some point. When I get used to what it really means to use Git and GitHub!

For now, I would love to chat about anything related to DevOps, Cloud and IT in general! Please contact me if you can! (Do it!)
